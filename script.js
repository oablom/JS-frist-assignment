// Hej Helena!

/* This is my answer to the question:
 Parentheses are needed because multiplication and subtraction both have the precedence number 16. With addition instead of multiplication, for example, instead, this wouldn't be a problem, because addition has a lower precedence number than subtraction. With the same precedence number, JS wouldn't know which to execute first. */

/* Answer the question why JavaScript needs the parentheses in thiscase? You can put your answer as plain text when you hand in theassignment.
